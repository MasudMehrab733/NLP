In the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), raw text data is often messy and inconsistent. 
Before applying machine learning models, it's crucial to clean and prepare the text—a process known as text preprocessing. 
This article will walk you through the most essential preprocessing steps, techniques, and libraries commonly used in NLP.
📌 Why Text Preprocessing?
Text data can include:
Punctuation
Stopwords
Inconsistent casing
Irregular spacing
Slang, emojis, or typos
Preprocessing helps normalize this data to extract meaningful patterns and improve model performance.

Here we go with step-by-step through the common operations:
1. Tokenization
   - Word Tokenization
   - Sentence Tokenization
2. Lowercasing
3. Removing Punctuations
4. Removing StopWrods
5. Remove HTML tags
6. Remove URL's
7. Handling ChatWords
8. Spelling Correction
9. Handling Emojis🙂
10. Stemming
11. Lemmatizing
12. POS tagging
13. NER (Named ENtity Recognition)
14. Regex (Regular Expression)
