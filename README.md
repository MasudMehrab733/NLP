In the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), raw text data is often messy and inconsistent. 
Before applying machine learning models, it's crucial to clean and prepare the textâ€”a process known as text preprocessing. 
This article will walk you through the most essential preprocessing steps, techniques, and libraries commonly used in NLP.
ðŸ“Œ Why Text Preprocessing?
Text data can include:
Punctuation
Stopwords
Inconsistent casing
Irregular spacing
Slang, emojis, or typos
Preprocessing helps normalize this data to extract meaningful patterns and improve model performance.

Here we go with step-by-step through the common operations:
1. Tokenization
   - Word Tokenization
   - Sentence Tokenization
2. Lowercasing
3. Removing Punctuations
4. Removing StopWrods
5. Stemming
6. Lemmatizing
7. POS tagging
8. NER (Named ENtity Recognition)
9. Regex (Regular Expression)
